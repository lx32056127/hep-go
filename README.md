# hep-go

HEP Parser written in Go. Supports v1, v2, and v3.

Requires http://github.com/james4e/sipparser library for parsing the SIP body.

The original library, github.com/dgv/sipparser, is no longer maintained or available. As a result, the library has been replaced with github.com/james4e/sipparser, which provides the same functionality and is compatible with existing test cases.
